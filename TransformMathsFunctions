Plane-Plane Intersection : find the line which is the intersection of 2 planes
p1 : a point of the plane 1
n1 : the normal of the plane 1
*/

fn planePlaneIntersect p1 n1 p2 n2 = (
	-- n1, n2 are normalized
	local lineVector = cross n1 n2
	local proj1=(dot n1 p1)*n1
	local proj2=(dot n2 p2)*n2
	local perp1=cross n1 (normalize lineVector)
	local perp2=cross n2 (normalize lineVector)
	local cr = cross (proj2-proj1) perp2
	local intersectionPoint = proj1 + (perp1*( (dot cr lineVector) / ((length lineVector)^2)) )
	ray intersectionPoint lineVector
	)
I think that it is not the easiest solution. If you know a better means…
